# Music-Artist-Identification
Building a deep learning model that can recognize the voice of a artist(also known as dynamic voice identifer)for a given song with minimal training data.
# Data preprocessing
 ## Conversion of audio from .mp3 to .wav format

 ## Transfer Learning (Feature Extraction)
 I used pre-trained VGG-16(16-layers Convolutional Neural Network) CNN model in order to extract features from the spectrogram images
